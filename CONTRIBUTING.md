# API Support

The Vega Lite API includes [a number of features](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) which are not yet implemented here. If there's one you like, please add it! Be sure to use the building blocks in `encodings.js` and `scales.js`. For conditional logic it's often useful to add a new method to `feature.js`.

## Architecture

Architecture is guided by the [Grammar of Graphics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0).
